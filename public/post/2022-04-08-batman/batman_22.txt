Hey!

3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,359
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,279
<i>Good evening and welcome
to GC-1 News live at 8am.</i>

5
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,879
<i>Our top story tonight...</i>

6
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,319
<i>Recently released polls have left
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,266
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots
challenger Bella Real in a dead heat.</i>

8
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,359
<i>Last night things got hot in their final
debate before the election next Tuesday.</i>

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,479
<i>Well, my young opponent here wants to
hollow out the Gotham Renewal Program...</i>

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,479
<i>founded by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

11
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,199
<i>Cuts in funds for vital
projects like our dyke...</i>

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,719
<i>and the safety net for those who need it.</i>

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,959
<i>The renewal program is suspended.  This
city has been renewing itself for 20 years.</i>

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,999
<i>Look where it got us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

15
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,319
<i>-Murder and drug use are at historic highs.
-Now wait... Now wait.</i>

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,719
<i>We have a masked
vigilante walking the streets.</i>

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,879
<i>Under my administration...</i>

18
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,559
<i>The Gotham PD has dealt a serious
blow to organized crime and the drug trade.</i>

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,199
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was the
largest drug case in the city's history.</i>

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,719
<i>But drops and other drugs are
still widely used.  It's gotten worse.</i>

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,079
<i>I am not saying there is no work to be done.</i>

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,097
<i>But listen, I have a beautiful wife and
a little son, okay?  And I will not rest...</i>

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,639
hey

24
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,876
Yes, I'm watching it now.

25
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,440
Why is she still tied up?

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,264
But I thought we'd get a
boost in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

27
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,719
You know what?
I can't see this anymore

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,719
Just call me in the morning, okay?

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,238
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

30
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
<i>We need a leader,
Mr. Mitchell, not a cheerleader.</i>

31
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,679
<i>And someone who
tells people the truth.</i>

32
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,377
<i>Thursday 31 October.</i>

33
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,999
<i>City streets are packed for the holiday.</i>

34
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,919
<i>Even in the rain.</i>

35
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,599
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element...</i>

36
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,839
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

37
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,839
<i>But I'm in too.</i>

38
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,519
<i>Watch after.</i>

39
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,559
<i>Two years of nights have
turned me into a nocturnal animal.</i>

40
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,759
<i>I have to choose my goals carefully.</i>

41
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,159
-Come on!  Give me the money.
-In order.

42
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,939
-Let's go!  Let's go!
-Good Good!

43
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,539
<i>It's a big city.</i>

44
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,836
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

45
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,399
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

46
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,359
Look at this guy man.

47
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,439
Boom!

48
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,399
So good man.  I'm talking about that!

49
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,919
Yo, let's see your hits.

50
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,039
You are that.

51
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,454
<i>We now have a signal.  When I'm needed</i>

52
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,159
<i>But when that light hits the sky...</i>

53
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,319
<i>It's not just a phone call.</i>

54
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,399
<i>It's a warning.</i>

55
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,199
<i>To them.</i>

56
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,079
<i>Fear...</i>

57
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,198
<i>is a tool.</i>

58
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,798
You're out of your mind?
Watch where you're going, Drophead!

59
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,838
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

60
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,159
<i>But I am the shadow.</i>

61
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,879
come on, come on

62
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,919
-Hey, go ahead man!  Walk!
-Get him!

63
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,519
-Come on man!
-What are you doing'?

64
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,639
Help!

65
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,079
someone help me

66
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,799
Help, help!

67
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,919
Where are you going, huh?

68
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,599
Come on.

69
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,399
come on man  break it

70
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,999
You can't move, huh?

71
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,959
Now kick his ass out.

72
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,879
Show time.  Show time man.

73
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,399
come on man

74
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,799
Come on.  do it man

75
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,799
do you see this guy

76
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,602
The hell are you supposed to be?

77
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,839
i am revenge

78
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,919
Holy shit.  He is it.

79
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,719
Hey man.  No no no!

80
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,759
please don't hurt me

81
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,159
police action.

82
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,399
He's with me, officer.

83
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,238
Are you kidding me, sir?

84
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,879
you let him in here?

85
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,359
Martinez, let him through.

86
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,759
Damn freak.

87
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,719
What do we know?

88
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,799
Detective?

89
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,319
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

90
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,999
We have blunt force trauma.
lacerations on the head.

91
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,831
He was often beaten.  And difficult.

92
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,679
All the blood is coming out of his head?

93
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,107
No.

94
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,639
Forgiveness.

95
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,839
Most of it comes from his hand.

96
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,297
Thumb was severed.

97
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,199
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

98
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,479
He was alive when it was cut off.

99
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:38,279
ecchymosis...

100
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,959
around the wound.

101
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,159
Security downstairs said
the family was trick-or-treating.

102
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,886
The mayor was alone up here.

103
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,039
The killer may have come through the skylight.

104
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,079
They said there was a map.

105
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,879
Yes.

106
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,039
"From your secret friend.  Who?

107
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,959
"No idea?

108
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,430
"Let's play a game, just me and you.

109
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,079
"What does a liar do when he's dead?"

110
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,479
There is also a cipher.

111
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,159
Does that ring a bell?

112
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,917
What is going on here?

113
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,239
I asked him to come, Pete.

114
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,199
This is a crime scene.

115
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,479
It's Mitchell, for heaven's sake!

116
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,479
I have the press downstairs.

117
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,439
You know, I slacked off a lot,
Jim, because we have history.

118
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,329
But that goes way beyond the limit.

119
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,119
Wait.

120
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,752
-He's involved?
-No, he's not involved.

121
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,039
How do you know?

122
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,239
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

123
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,919
What do you do with me?
We used to be partners.

124
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,679
Just trying to find the connection, Pete.

125
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,719
He lies still.

126
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,839
Forgiveness?

127
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,559
The riddle.

128
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:36,443
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

129
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,115
oh jesus

130
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,159
This has got to be your favorite
night of the year, right, mate?

131
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,999
Happy fucking Halloween.

132
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,399
Excuse me, Commissioner.

133
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,157
You are ready to testify.

134
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,879
I want him out of here.

135
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,639
Now!

136
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,399
Come on.

137
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,399
Yes.

138
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,159
The boy found him.

139
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
Was anyone else in the
house when you arrived?

140
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,593
We really gotta go, man.

141
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:08,905
<i>Tonight a son lost a father.</i>

142
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,239
A woman lost a man.

143
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,039
And I lost a friend.

144
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,559
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city...

145
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,839
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

146
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,319
<i>That was a really senseless crime...</i>

147
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,519
<i>and we are actively pursuing
any investigative lead we have...</i>

148
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,679
<i>to identify and hunt
down the culprit.</i>

149
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,999
<i>I spoke to the governor...</i>

150
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,919
<i>I wish I could say I make a difference...</i>

151
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
<i>But I do not know.</i>

152
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,319
<i>Murder, robbery, assault.</i>

153
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,530
<i>Two years later they are all up.</i>

154
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,009
<i>And now this.</i>

155
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,439
<i>The city eats itself.</i>

156
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,399
<i>It may not be salvageable.</i>

157
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,799
<i>But I have to try.</i>

158
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,741
<i>push me</i>

159
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,359
<i>These nights everyone rolls up in a hurry...</i>

160
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,279
<i>behind the mask.</i>

161
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,039
<i>Sometimes in the morning...</i>

162
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,999
<i>I have to force myself to remember...</i>

163
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,919
<i>everything that happened</i>

164
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,980
<i>Incredible breaking

<i>Again, four-year acting Mayor
of Gotham, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

166

<i>And this is definitely not the first time...</i>

171
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,870
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

172

<i>In fact, by some weird coincidence,

<i>that celebrated billionaire philanthropist
Dr.  Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha...</i>

175
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,919

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,879
<i>when he and the city police
launched a major covert operation...</i>

179
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,999
<i>which led to the arrest of notorious
mafia criminal Salvatore Maroni...</i>

180
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,239
<i>with what is to date the largest
drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

181
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,799
I assume you've heard of this?

182
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:25,831
Yes.

183
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,159
Ah, I see.

184
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,959
<i>All the blood is coming out of his head?</i>

185
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,759
Dear God.

186
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,519
<i>There is also a cipher.</i>

187
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,759
<i>Does that ring a bell?</i>

188
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,759
The killer left this for Batman?

189
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,879
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

190
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,959
Apparently.

191
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,039
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

192
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,359
Why is he texting you?

193
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,919
<i>It's Mitchell, for heaven's sake!</i>

194
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,119
I do not know yet.

195
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,639
<i>I have the press downstairs.</i>

196
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,999
To shower.

197
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,079
Our accounting friends at Wayne
Enterprises are coming over for breakfast.

198
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,119
Here?  Why?

199
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:29,439
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

200
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,559
I have no time for that.

201
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,199
It's getting serious, Bruce.

202
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:35,339
If this keeps up, it won't be
long before you're out of things.

203
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,119
I don't care.

204
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,445
-Any of these.
-You don't care about your family's inheritance?

205
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,919
What I do is my family's legacy.

206
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,239
If I can't change anything here...

207
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,719
If I can't do anything...

208
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,479
then I don't care what happens to me.

209
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,719
I'm afraid of that.

210
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,279
Alfred, stop it.

211
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,239
You're not my father.

212
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,399
I am aware.

213
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,919
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

214
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,079
Some fresh berries there.

215
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,439
What are you doing right now?

216
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,377
I only remember my days in the circus.

217
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,704
That's actually pretty hard to grasp.

218
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,321
Where did you get those O's from?

219
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,744
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

220
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,104
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S and T.

221
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,390
So I look for double symbols
to start and try letters...

222
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,879
let's see where it leads.

223
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,679
That is interesting.

224
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,037
Mr Pennyworth?

225
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,479
Yes, Dory?

226
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,159
The accountants are here.

227
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,239
Please see her in, Dory.

228
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,439
<i>What if it's not a subkey?</i>

229
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,999
What do you mean?

230
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,679
What if this is the whole key?

231
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,399
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

232
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,399
Use only the letters of "He
Lies Still" and leave the rest...

233
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,719
Empty.  Yes I understand.

234
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,973
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

235
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:10,793
I don't know how to do that...

236
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,833
Damned.

237
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,095
yes he has a car

238
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,519
I guess it's good to be mayor.

239
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,319
Where do you even start?

240
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,159
Are you sure this isn't a jump?
“Driving” can mean anything.

241
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,359
You do not trust me?

242
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,959
You mean like you trust me?

243
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,959
It's been two years now and I
don't even know who you are man.

244
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,079
There.

245
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,439
what are we looking for

246
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,479
A USB port.

247
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,519
USB?

248
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,007
What?

249
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,631
"USB stick.

250
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,064
Jesus.

251
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,239
It's encrypted.

252
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,919
try this

253
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,211
Oh, this guy is hilarious.

254
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,719
Well well well.

255
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,439
So much for family values.

256
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,716
Who is she?

257
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,479
No idea.

258
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,063
But this is the penguin, the
right hand of Carmine Falcone.

259
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,997
i know who he is

260
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:19,370
What was that?

261
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,999
Shit, shit!  The drive.

262
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,121
It sent the photos from my account.

263
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,657
Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all.

264
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,839
Jesus.

265
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,359
I'll get hell for this.
Pete will blow a seal.

266
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,919
"He lies still."

267
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,199
About you?

268
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,960
Maybe.

269
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,079
This is the Iceberg Lounge.

270
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,479
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was hiding.

271
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,719
Never go in without a search warrant.

272
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,142
Yes.

273
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:05,479
know who i am

274
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,970
Yes.  I have an idea.

275
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,919
I want to see the penguin.

276
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,879
I don't know what you're talking about, buddy.

277
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:20,319
What is the problem?

278
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,759
Says he wants to see the penguin.

279
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,959
Penguin?  There is no penguin here.

280
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,559
I tried to tell him that.

281
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,999
Get out of here, freak.  You hear me?

282
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,039
Or the little suit will
get blood all over it.

283
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,479
mine or yours

284
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,679
Get him!

285
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,919
I saw the whole thing.

286
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,159
He's over there!

287
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,759
What is your problem?

288
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
Hey!  Put the bat down
or I'll blow your head off!

289
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,719
Take it easy honey.

290
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,639
are you looking for me

291
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,319
I see you met the twins.

292
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,519
Boy, you're everything they say, aren't you?

293
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,879
I guess we both are.

294
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,799
How are you?

295
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,879
i am oz

296
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,199
Who is she?

297
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,085
I really don't know, boss.

298
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,199
I might have come
out at the same time...

299
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,559
but I didn't roll with them.

300
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,959
It's okay, honey.

301
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,279
Mr. Vengeance here, he doesn't bite.
Come on.

302
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,199
Thanks, dear.

303
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,439
Here you go, champion.

304
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,239
I want to know who she is and
what she has to do with this murder.

305
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,079
-Whose murder?
-The mayor's.

306
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,759
is that the mayor

307
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,839
Oh shit, that's it.  Look at this.

308
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,399
Don't make me hurt you

309
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,437
you better take a look
you know my reputation

310
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,558
Yes I do.  Do you?

311
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,719
Look...

312
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,767
I'm just the owner, okay?

313
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,870
I mean, what people do here
has nothing to do with me.

314
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,959
tell you one thing

315
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,959
Whoever she is, she's a hot girl.

316
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,639
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

317
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,679
What?  Too early?

318
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,951
They'll let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

319
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,279
Taxi!

320
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:32,770
Taxi!

321
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,799
Hey, it's me

322
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,479
honey, what's up?

323
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,159
Slowly, slower.  I can not...

324
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,959
In the news?

325
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,879
In order.  No.
no stay there  wait for me, okay?

326
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,879
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

327
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,559
Listen, baby, we're getting out of
here right now, okay?  I promise.

328
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,839
If we have to leave
earlier, we'll leave tonight.

329
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,439
Goddamn.

330
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,359
<i>...photos of assassinated Mayor Don Mitchell
Jr. with a younger, mysterious woman.</i>

331
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,279
<i>A shocking development, the
police believe the photos themselves...</i>

332
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,639
<i>Now they are urging her
to contact the GCPD...</i>

333
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,359
You're pretty good at that.

334
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,039
Hey!  Give me that.

335
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,719
Did he hurt her?
Is that why you killed him?

336
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,439
What?  Oh please.
Just give me the damn...

337
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,239
Listen, honey, you got the wrong idea, okay?

338
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,839
I haven't killed anyone.
I am here for my friend.

339
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,159
She's trying to fucking get out of here
and that son of a bitch stole her passport.

340
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,479
what does she know

341
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,839
Whatever it is, it scared her so
much she doesn't even want to tell me.

342
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,479
She seemed upset.

343
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,839
back with you

344
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,319
let's talk to her

345
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,599
Anna!

346
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:54,937
Infant!

347
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,599
Anna!

348
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,359
Anna!

349
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,799
<i>It's going to be chilly tonight.
It will go into the 40's.</i>

350
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,919
<i>More breaking news this hour...</i>

351
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,359
<i>while the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

352
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,719
<i>And this time, the killer came
forward to request a loan online...</i>

353
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,599
Jesus, what are they going to do to her?
She is just a child.

354
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,359
Shit, they took my phone.

355
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,239
<i>His victim, longtime head of Gotham
City PD, Commissioner Pete Savage.</i>

356
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,439
<i>He was found dead tonight...</i>

357
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,728
<i>at the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricomer area.</i>

358
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
<i>The killer posted the following
message on social media...</i>

359
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,079
<i>and we must warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

360
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,839
<i>Hello folks from Gotham.</i>

361
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,999
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

362
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,039
<i>On Halloween night</i>

363
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,879
<i>I killed your mayor because
he wasn't who he said he was.</i>

364
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,159
<i>But I'm not done yet.</i>

365
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,479
<i>Here's another...</i>

366
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,279
<i></i>

367
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,679
<i>who will soon lose face.</i>

368
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,199
<i>I will kill again and again and again...</i>

369
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,119
<i>until our judgment day...</i>

370
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,279
<i>when finally the truth about our city...</i>

371
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,079
<i>be exposed.</i>

372
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,159
<i>Good bye!</i>

373
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,079
<i>Commissioner Savage served a distinguished...</i>

374
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,479
<i>30-year career with the GCPD...</i>

375
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,799
Holy shit, I saw that guy too.

376
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,159
In the club.

377
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,239
The Iceberg Lounge?

378
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,399
44 below.

379
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,399
What is it?

380
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,159
The club in the club.

381
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,159
The real club.

382
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,999
It's a mob hangout.

383
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,079
Do you work there?

384
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,759
Selina?

385
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,599
No, I only work in the bar upstairs.

386
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,679
But I see her coming in.

387
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,359
WHO?

388
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,839
Lots of people who shouldn't be there.
I can tell you.

389
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,159
Your basic sincere citizen types.

390
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,959
you will help me

391
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,039
for your friend

392
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,959
you have many cats

393
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,439
I have something against strays.

394
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,787
You are not safe here.

395
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,079
I can look after myself.

396
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,959
<i>Two public figures have now
died in the last two nights...</i>

397
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,472
<i>and just days before the election.</i>

398
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:06,839
<i>Police and city officials
are looking for a killer...</i>

399
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,079
<i>and hope to find him before he kills again.</i>

400
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,079
He was waiting for him at the gym.

401
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,399
Pete always liked to work out late into
the night when no one else was around.

402
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,839
There's a pin mark on his neck.

403
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,999
Injected him with arsenic.

404
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,359
rat poison.

405
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,643
Yes.

406
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,319
That seems to be his issue here.

407
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,252
look at this thing

408
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,159
It's a maze.

409
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:07,068
What kind of insane son of a
bitch would do that to a person?

410
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,839
More symbols.

411
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,839
It's a different cipher.

412
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,759
He blew these up after
his message went viral.

413
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,879
Bastard murder you and your reputation.

414
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,279
The guy squeezes drops.
At the east end.

415
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,079
I do not get it.

416
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,599
Why would Pete get
involved in something like that?

417
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,319
Looks like he got greedy.

418
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:33,639
are you kidding me

419
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,359
After everything we did
to take out the Maronis?

420
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,839
We blew their entire operation, and
then he caves in to a sleazy dealer?

421
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,039
Maybe he's not who you thought.

422
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,679
You make it sound like he made it come.

423
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,359
He was a cop.

424
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,039
Crossed a line.

425
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:24,746
"I'm angry with her.

426
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:28,591
"You want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

427
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,799
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

428
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,479
"Bring him out and
you'll find out where I am."

429
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,359
The hell is that?

430
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,239
"Bring him to light"?  "Find the rat"?

431
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:50,852
I do not know.

432
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,879
Lieutenant.

433
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,399
you come back

434
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,759
We have to get out of here.

435
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,079
Come on.

436
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,919
I don't know anything about these things.

437
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,519
I need to see in there, that hunting ground.

438
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,119
Hey, why am I starting to
feel like a fish on a hook?

439
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,439
I'm just looking for Annika.

440
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,359
Boy you are a real sweetheart.

441
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,999
You really don't care what
happens to me tonight, do you?

442
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,839
Look at me.

443
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,679
Looks good.  Here.

444
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,759
I have you.  Can you hear me?

445
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,759
Yes.

446
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,399
hey where are you going

447
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,199
Hospitality.

448
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,719
<i>This is one of the guys I
was with the other night.</i>

449
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,999
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

450
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,639
"Kenzie, William."

451
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,279
He's an off-duty police officer.

452
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,839
Are you sure no one can
see these things in my eyes?

453
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,239
Do not worry.  I am watching you.

454
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,919
don't look away  I need time to do IDs.

455
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,079
Great.

456
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,719
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

457
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:49,239
Feels good, doesn't it?

458
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,599
yes, sweetheart  Feels really good.

459
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,279
<i>Jesus, I hate jerks.</i>

460
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,342
For real?

461
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,759
Because when I first saw you, it
looked like you were dealing with Penguin.

462
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:05,050
You don't know what you're talking about.
Can't we...

463
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,399
Can't we do that now?

464
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,959
Wait.  Who was that?

465
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,079
Ah, I saw him.

466
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,359
<i>Look back.</i>

467
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,205
When I look back, it will
be a whole can full of worms.

468
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,639
I need to see his face.

469
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:19,624
Jesus.

470
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,959
This is the DA.

471
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,999
Gil Colson.

472
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,759
And he comes over.  You happy?

473
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,079
<i>talk to him</i>

474
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:37,136
hey  How are you?

475
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:38,319
Hello.

476
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,279
i am gil

477
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,239
Hey, aren't you the DA?

478
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,239
Yes.

479
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:45,479
Impressive.  i saw you on tv

480
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,001
Is that right?

481
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:49,628
I've never seen you here before.

482
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,549
It's one hell of a time being the new girl...

483
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,239
Because people are all a little nervous.

484
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,839
<i>Oh darling I'm living on the edge</i>

485
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,039
<i>Is that right?</i>

486
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,519
<i>I like it.</i>

487
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,999
Do you want to come over?

488
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,159
For sure.

489
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,519
<i>-This is Travis.
-Hey.</i>

490
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,999
<i>Do you want a seat over there?</i>

491
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,100
<i>- Richie.  Valley.
-Hey.</i>

492
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,039
That's half the DA's office.

493
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,359
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

494
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,359
Hello.

495
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,439
This is Cheri.  Don't bother
with her, she's just taking a break.

496
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:19,359
Our sorrows drown.

497
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,999
<i>want a drop</i>

498
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,239
<i>no i am good  But you enjoy.</i>

499
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,759
<i>Hope you do not mind.</i>

500
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,999
<i>I have a lot on my shoulders with
this psychopath walking around.</i>

501
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,319
He's wasted.

502
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,534
no shit

503
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,199
<i>i like this girl</i>

Oh hey, I like you too!

505
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,999
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's after
the most powerful people in town.</i>

506
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,159
<i>he knows so much</i>

507
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,559
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

508
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,999
<i>What are you talking about?
Yes he does!  What about that rat...</i>

509
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,919
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

510
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,919
<i>-Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
-Hey.  The rat.

511
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,079
<i>-Slow down.</i>
-Ask him about the rat.

512
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,839
<i>Hey, what's that with a rat?</i>

513
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,359
<i>I mean...</i>

514
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,799
<i>there was a rat.  We had an informant.</i>

515
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,719
<i>We had extensive information
about Salvatore Maroni.</i>

516
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,519
<i>That's how we got him
out of the Drops business.</i>

517
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,199
He talks about the Maroni case.

518
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,679
<i>But if this guy knows, it will come out.</i>

519
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,439
<i>And when that happens,
this whole town will fall apart.</i>

520
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,439
<i>OK, I don't want to hear that.</i>

521
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,319
<i>That's the kind of pillow talk that
made this Russian girl disappear.</i>

522
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,559
<i>What do you know about it?</i>

523
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,319
<i>Anyone want a drink?</i>

524
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,439
<i>i want a drink</i>

525
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,799

526
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,919
<i>wait where are you going</i>

527
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,039
She knows Annika.

528
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,519
No, stay with the DA.

529
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,639
I told you that I'm looking for my boyfriend.

530
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,759
-Where is Annika?
-Out of my face.  I do not know you.

531
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,919
Yes, but you know her.  Who took her?

532
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,559
-What did you hear?  Is she OK?
-Jesus Christ, keep your voice low.

533
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,839
What, do you have a death wish?

534
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,359
Hey, what's the deal, ladies?

535
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,399
There's no problem.  It's just girl talk.

536
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,959
<i>Let's keep it festive down here, okay?</i>

537
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,199
Sure Oz

538
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,999
<i>hey</i>

539
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,719
hey

540
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,999
It's been a long time since I've seen you down here.

541
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,599
How you been?

542
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,159
yes i was ok

543
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,319
<i>I was only...</i>

544
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:28,121
<i>I was about to go back upstairs.</i>

545
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,919
Fountain...

546
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,599
<i>don't be a stranger</i>

547
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,999
-You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob place.

548
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,399
You didn't tell me you were
in a relationship with him.

549
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,559
<i>I have no relationship with him, okay?</i>

550
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,479
-Well, it didn't look like it.
-<i>Forget it.</i>

551
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,639
wait what are you doing

552
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,239
<i>-Listen, I can't do
this anymore.</i>-No!  No!

553
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,759
Taxi!

554
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,759
Hey!

555
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,479
I lost you in there

556
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,719
Yes, I have to go.

557
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,039
Oh, you need a ride?

558
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,039
That's me

559
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,079
Taxi!

560
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,399
I am good.

561
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,519
I hope...

562
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,519
See you.

563
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,959
just hold still

564
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,479
What do you know about a
confidential informant in the Maroni case?

565
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,319
Yes, of course there was.

566
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,799
That's the rat we're looking for.

567
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,639
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

568
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,239
If we find the rat, maybe
it will lead us to him.

569
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,759
Where do you get that from?

570
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,679
I have a source who spoke to the DA's office tonight.

571
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,919
Gil is very nervous.

572
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,359
I believe the killer is targeting
people associated with this case.

573
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,319
I worked this case.

574
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,319
Riddler isn't after you.

575
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,479
How do you know?

576
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,279
you are not corrupt

577
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,799
Colson is dirty?

578
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,199
Maybe...

579
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,119
I go after him.  Lean
on him to give up the rat.

580
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,599
It is too dangerous.  You
made a secret deal with this guy.

581
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,999
Who knows how many people it will affect.

582
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,399
Politician.  Police.  The courts.

583
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,359
It could tear the whole city apart.

584
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,799
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

585
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,199
And Riddler is the match.

586
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,159
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

587
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,559
<i>I told you it's a mob place.</i>

588
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,279
<i>You didn't tell me you were
in a relationship with him.</i>

589
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,759
<i>I have no relationship...</i>

590
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,319
<i>You didn't tell me you were
in a relationship with him.</i>

591
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,479
<i>I have no relationship with him.  In order?</i>

592
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,639
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

593
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,799
<i>I told you it's a mob place.</i>

594
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,439
<i>You didn't tell me you were
in a relationship with him.</i>

595
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,319
<i>I have no relationship with him.  In order?</i>

596
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,559
Pretty.

597
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,159
Is she a new friend of yours?

598
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,959
I am not sure.

599
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,279
Looks like you pissed her off.

600
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,639
Should I take that as a good sign?

601
00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:44,597
What?

602
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,679
Her clothes.

603
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,799
Is Bruce Wayne actually making an appearance?

604
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,839
There is a public memorial to Mayor Mitchell.

605
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,719
Serial killers like to monitor
the response to their crimes.

606
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,279
Riddler might not be able to resist.

607
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,839
It reminds me.

608
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,039
I've taken the liberty of doing a
little work on this latest cipher.

609
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,999
The one from the rat maze.

610
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,519
I'm afraid his Spanish isn't perfect...

611
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,119
but I'm pretty sure that translates
to "You are <i>El Rata Alada</i>."

612
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,159
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

613
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,319
"rat with wings"?

614
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,039
It is colloquial for "dove".
Does that mean anything to you?

615
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,279
Yes.

616
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,919
A rotary pigeon.

617
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,719
Where are your cufflinks?

618
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,839
I couldn't find her.

619
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,199
Well, you can't go out like that.

620
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,119
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

621
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,039
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

622
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,039
And what about you?  are you wayne

623
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,759
Your father gave them to me.

624
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,639
No more lies!  No more lies!

625
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,759
Mr Wayne.  Understood.  All
right, you go right down there.

626
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,959
Is that Bruce Wayne?

627
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,759
Mr Wayne!  Mr Wayne!  Mr Wayne!

628
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,879
hold it

629
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,479
are you good guys

630
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,999
Good.

631
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,239
We're fine, Mr Falcone.

632
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,959
Mister?

633
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,439
Hey!

634
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,759
Give us a wide berth here, okay?

635
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,519
Hey watch out guys.

636
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,279
There you have the prince of the city.

637
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,879
Any event, huh?

638
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,079
Brought out the one guy in town
who's more reclusive than me.

639
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,519
Thought you'd never leave the shoreline.

640
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,159
Aren't you afraid that
someone will shoot you?

641
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,319
Why?  Because your father is not there?

642
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,599
Oz, do you know Bruce Wayne?

643
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,759
wow is that right

644
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,799
His father saved my life.

645
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,039
I was shot in the chest.  Exactly here.

646
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:05,666
I couldn't go to a hospital so
we showed up on his doorstep.

647
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,119
Is operated directly at the dining table.

648
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,519
Kid here, he saw the whole thing, at
the top of the stairs and looking down.

649
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,959
I remember your face

650
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,879
Don't you think that meant
something, did he do that?

651
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,399
It meant he took the Hippocratic Oath.

652
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,319
"Hippocratic oath."

653
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,079
It's good.

654
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,799
Forgiveness.

655
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,399
Yes.

656
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,039
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all
for coming to today's memorial service...</i>

657
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,479
<i>to our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

658
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,399
<i>Our program will start shortly.</i>

659
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,519
<i>As a reminder, the family asked those
who wished to honor the Mayor's memory...</i>

660
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,119
<i>Consider making a donation
to a cause close to his heart...</i>

661
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,319
<i>the Gotham Renewal Fund...</i>

662
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,679
<i>the safety net of our city.</i>

663
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,639
What good is a safety net
that doesn't catch anyone?

664
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,439
Didn't help my daughter when
she needed it, I can tell you that.

665
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,759
The guy was just another rich scumbag.

666
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,599
He got what he deserved.

667
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,519
Do you know what i mean?

668
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,919
Hey, don't I know you?

669
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,159
Bruce Wayne.

670
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,919
Why didn't you call me back?

671
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,079
I'm sorry?

672
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,719
I'm Bella Real.  I'm running for mayor.

673
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,639
I wouldn't bother you here, but your
people keep telling me you're unavailable.

674
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,159
Will you go with me?

675
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,559
Mr Wayne.

676
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,799
Mr Wayne.

677
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,719
You know, you really
could do more for this town.

678
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,159
Her family has a history of philanthropy...

679
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,559
but as far as I can tell,
you're doing nothing.

680
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,159
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

681
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,079
Thanks.

682
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:04,929
My God.

683
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,199
I will pay my respects.
will you wait for me

684
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,879
I want to continue this.

685
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,039
Forgiveness.

686
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,999
I am sorry for your loss.

687
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,079
Thanks.

688
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,959
sorry boss  Can I talk to you?

689
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,039
Gil Colson is missing.

690
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,479
What?

691
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,799
Nothing has been heard from him since last night.

692
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,919
Christ, not again?

693
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,159
hey  Mr Wayne.

694
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,519
Are people looking for him, Jim?

695
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,439
Sent some guys over to his house.  Nothing at all.

696
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,399
What did his wife say?

697
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,799
She hadn't heard from him.

698
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,399
Get out of the car!

699
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,359
Get out of the car and show your hands!

700
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,879
Go out!

701
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,679
Pick her up!

702
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,599
Go out!  show them!

703
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,599
Heavens, it's Colson.

704
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,159
There's a bomb around his neck!

705
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,959
Let's clean this place up now!

706
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,639
We have to clear this place!

707
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,679
hey boys boys  Here we go.

708
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,119
We don't know if he's involved.

709
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,559
What is he looking at?

710
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,679
Holy shit.

711
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,239
Are you kidding me?

712
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,279
What the hell is he doing?

713
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,199
Gordon!

714
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,479
Your guy's gonna get himself killed in there.

715
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,479
Please.

716
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,399
He made me do it.  I am so sorry.

717
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,839
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said he would kill me.

718
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,079
I am so sorry.

719
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,159
Looks like a combination lock.

720
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,759
Can't we just cut it off?

721
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,157
Not if you want to keep your head.

722
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,119
<i>You came.</i>

723
01:06:50,011 --> 01:06:51,033
Who are you?

724
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,559
<i>To me?</i>

725
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,519
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

726
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,359
<i>I'm just an instrument...</i>

727
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,799
<i>here to uncover the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

728
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:06,317
"Expose"?

729
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:07,662
<i>Yes.</i>

730
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,319
<i>let's do it together, okay?</i>

731
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,879
<i>I tried to contact you.</i>

732
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,839
<i>You are part of it too.</i>

733
01:07:17,112 --> 01:07:18,728
How am I part of it?

734
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,279
<i>You'll see.</i>

735
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,479
hey boss  you better take a look

736
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,679
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

737
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:25,935
<i>We live.</i>

738
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:28,921
<i>You are here to watch our little process.</i>

739
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:31,379
<i>At the moment...</i>

740
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,904
<i>The man across from you, Mr. Colson...</i>

741
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:36,068
<i>is dead.</i>

742
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,079
Jesus, can we get someone out of here?
This psycho is going to kill me!

743
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,239
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

744
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,359
<i>Keep your mouth shut!  You
deserve to be dead after what you did!</i>

745
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,359
<i>You hear me?</i>

746
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,479
In order.

747
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,439
<i>I'll give you a chance</i>

748
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,359
<i>Nobody ever gave me a chance.</i>

749
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,399
<i>Now...</i>

750
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,199
<i>since I was a child...</i>

751
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,919
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

752
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,839
<i>For me they are a retreat...</i>

753
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,279
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

754
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,559
<i>Perhaps they can give you
some comfort, too, Mr. Colson.</i>

755
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,999
You want me to do riddles?

756
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,719
<i>Three puzzles in two minutes.</i>

757
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,879
<i>You give me the answers and
I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

758
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,279
<i>-Do you understand?</i>
-Yes.

759
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,559
ok ok  So I just...

760
01:08:37,736 --> 01:08:38,741
you want me too

761
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,159
<i>Mystery number one...</i>

762
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,839
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind...</i>

763
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,639
<i>"but if it's denied, it's
violence you can find."</i>

764
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,119
wait wait wait!  Can you repeat that?

765
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,279
"Horrible"?  "Poetic"?

766
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,839
-"Justice."
-Huh?

767
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,959
The answer is "justice".

768
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,279
-Justice?  <i>-Yes!</i>

769
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,839
-Oh God.  <i>Justice!</i>

770
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,319
<i>And you should be an
arm of justice in this town...</i>

771
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,879
<i>along with the late Mayor
and Police Commissioner...</i>

772
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,199
<i>aren't you, Mr. Colson?</i>

773
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,399
Of course, of course.  Naturally.

774
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,959
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

775
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,159
<i>"If you are justice, please don't lie.</i>

776
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,399
<i>"What is the price of your blind eye?"</i>

777
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,279
<i>-"The price"?</i>
-"Bribes."

778
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,599
Oh God.  "bribes"?

779
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,959
He asks you how much it
cost you to turn your back.

780
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,399
<i>Fifty eight seconds!</i>

781
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,759
-How much?
-Nothing at all!

782
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,079
-How much?
-Ten thousand.  Ten Gs a month.

783
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,439
I get a monthly payment just
not to prosecute certain cases.

784
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,359
Which cases?

785
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,719
He didn't ask me that!  Come on!  ten thousand.

786
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,999
-That's my answer.  It's ten grand!
-<i>Okay.  OK, OK.</i>

787
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,759
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

788
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,679
<i>Just one more before
your time runs out.</i>

789
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,159
<i>Last riddle.</i>

790
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,559
<i>"Since your righteousness is so exquisite...</i>

791
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,879
<i>"Please let us know which
vermin you are being paid for."</i>

792
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,119
- "What vermin"?
-The rat.

793
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,719
The informant you're all protecting
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

794
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,639
-How do you know about this?
-What's his name?

795
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,759
<i>twenty seconds.</i>

796
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,359
-No.

797
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,679
-No.
-He will kill you.

798
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,679
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

799
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,439
When I go out like this, it's just me.

800
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:15,599
But if I reveal that name, I
have family, people I love.

801
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,079
-He will kill her too.
-Who will?

802
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,519
- People are watching.
-Which people?

803
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,631
It's so much bigger than
you can ever imagine.

804
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,914
-It's the whole system!
-<i>Five!</i>

805
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,971
<i>Four!</i>

806
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,479
-Oh God, have mercy on me...
<i>-Three!</i>

807
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,359
<i>Good bye!</i>

808
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,759
-Who do you think he is under there?
-Take it easy.

809
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:00,919
I want to see.

810
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,399
What is that thing?  Leather?

811
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,639
What's on his eyes?

812
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,159
Who cares?  i want to see his face

813
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,439
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

814
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,519
Hey!

815
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,559
Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

816
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,399
Hey!  Hey!

817
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:18,150
Relax, damn it!

818
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,799
You protecting this guy, Jim?

819
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,839
He got involved in an active hostage situation.

820
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,319
Colson's blood is on his hands.

821
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,799
Maybe it's yours.

822
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,239
What would you say?

823
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,959
He would rather die than talk.

824
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,759
What was he afraid of?

825
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,839
You?

826
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,399
You son of a bitch.

827
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,079
Do you have any idea
what trouble you're in?

828
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,679
You could be an accessory to murder.

829
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,879
Why do we play games...

830
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:53,879
Get him!  Come on!

831
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,599
Back!  Back!

832
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,199
Great, now I've got
you attacking an officer!

833
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,399
- You made me attack three.
-Hey!

834
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,359
What's wrong with you?
This is not the way to do this!

835
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,519
you too now?

836
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,079
Let me handle this, chief.
just give me a minute

837
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,599
You wanna risk yourself
for that bastard, Jim?

838
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,199
just give me a minute
I'll get him to cooperate.

839
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,479
OK, give him the room.

840
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,399
Two minutes.

841
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,759
you listen to me

842
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,319
We have to get you out of here.

843
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,762
That would heat you up a lot.

844
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,679
Well, you slapped me in the face.

845
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:02,218
take this key

846
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,919
through this door  Hallway to
the stairs leading to the roof.

847
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,639
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

848
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,959
Hey, hey, hey, what's up?

849
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,671
Who is the mustache with the broken nose?

850
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,759
This is Kenzie.  narcotics.

851
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,759
He's one of the guys I hooked
up with at the Iceberg Lounge.

852
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,359
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlight for the penguin?

853
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,039
Or he hires himself out as a cop.

854
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,039
-Jesus Christ!  Walk!

855
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:43,662
Someone stop him!

856
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,360
-There he is!
-Freeze!

857
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,639
Could have at least pulled that punch, man.

858
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,359
I did.

859
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,799
Bock has put you under investigation.
Do you really think he's involved?

860
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,879
I don't trust any of them.  Do you?

861
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,119
i only trust you

862
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,559
What's a drug cop doing
with Falcone's right hand?

863
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,079
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie is part of it.

864
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,999
You think penguin is the rat?

865
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,039
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

866
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,999
Penguin would have
been privy to a lot of dirt.

867
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,439
DA was also a regular.

868
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,159
Perhaps Penguin was in a bind
and a deal was his only way out.

869
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,439
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

870
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,479
That what?

871
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:42,926
The latest from Riddler.

872
01:15:43,246 --> 01:15:44,623
The cipher in the maze.

873
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,359
It means "a rat with wings".
Like a weirdo.

874
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,559
A penguin also has wings.

875
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,679
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

876
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,199
What about the Riddler?
He will kill again.

877
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,559
It's all connected.  Whether he
likes it or not, it's his game now.

878
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,799
You want to find Riddler,
we need to find that rat.

879
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,279
<i>Kenzie and the twins are coming towards you.</i>

880
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,479
There is penguin.

881
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,479
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

882
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,359
<i>Do you want to move in?</i>

883
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,719
<i>let's follow</i>

884
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,679
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

885
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,159
<i>I'm here.</i>

886
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,119
-How are you?
-Yes, good.  How are you?

887
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,799
Good Good.
Let's get out of this deluge.

888
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,479
It's a drug lab.  Drops.

889
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,759
This is a purchase.

890
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,999
Looks like they got Maroni's
operation up and running again.

891
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,233
Or they don't turn it off at all.

892
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,319
<i>What are you saying?</i>

893
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,559
The biggest drug bust in
GCPD history was a scam?

894
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,239
That just got complicated.

895
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,159
What do you mean?

896
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,559
Hey!  What happened?

897
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,999
are you ok

898
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,479
Dangerous crowd to steal from.

899
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,239
Jesus.

900
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,799
Is this how you get your kicks, honey?

901
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,559
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

902
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,399
Is that why you work in the club?

903
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,199
It was all just a score?

904
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,159
You know, I'd like to sit with you and
go through every gory detail, bat boy...

905
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,399
but these assholes are coming back.

906
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,679
Jesus!

907
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,319
Hey Revenge!

908
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:11,091
Do you think you can be after my money?

909
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,639
kenzie!  Get the money!

910
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,279
Hey!  What the...

911
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,079
Come on!  Come on!

912
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,519
This guy is crazy!

913
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,999
Come on!  Hey!

914
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,399
Relocation!

915
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,119
Evade!

916
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,279
Come on!

917
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,039
Evade!

918
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,359
I have you!

919
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,919
I have you!

920
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,319
Take that, you damn psycho!

921
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,919
I have you!

922
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,079
What the hell is that?
Good cop, damn cop?

923
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,719
-Who is the Riddler?
-Riddler?  How should I know?

924
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,159
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

925
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,359
Cops caught you doing something.
They wanted to shut you down, lock you up.

926
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,239
So you gave up a bigger
fish to save your ass.

927
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,439
You betrayed Salvatore Maroni.

928
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,719
His drop surgery.

929
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,319
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the prosecutor...

930
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,959
You got greedy, didn't you?
Wasn't enough, a big career bust.

931
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,839
They also wanted to take
over the drop business...

932
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,239
but they needed a minor
league mope like you to run it.

933
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,599
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

934
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,599
what are you crazy

935
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,039
Is that why you killed the girl?

936
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,119
I didn't kill a girl!

937
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,999
We know she worked
for you at 44 Below.

938
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,319
But she came too close, didn't she?

939
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,629
I found out from Mitchell that
you were the rat, so you killed her.

940
01:26:34,854 --> 01:26:36,632
But somehow Riddler figured it out too.

941
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,509
he knows so much about you

942
01:26:38,767 --> 01:26:40,717
- You must know about him.
-Who is he?

943
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,599
Boy you're a damn good duet here.

944
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,159
Why don't you start harmonizing?

945
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,999
There's just one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

946
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,639
I'm not a rat!

947
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,559
Do you have any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me if he heard that kind of talk?

948
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,797
You don't want to talk about rats, do you?

949
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,406
Maybe we can talk about what
they did to my partner's face.

950
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,079
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

951
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,719
-That was around his head!
-Come on!

952
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,839
Open your eyes!

953
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,399
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

954
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,839
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

955
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,759
Yes, a "rat with wings".  A rotary pigeon.

956
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,239
That is not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

957
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,959
It says you're <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

958
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,319
"You are <i>El Rata</i>"?  It says that?

959
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,599
Why, do you have something to tell us?

960
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,639
Yes!

961
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,279
- It's the worst Spanish I've ever heard.
-What?

962
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,959
It's <i>"La."</i>

963
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,399
"La" Rata.

964
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,799
What, is that Riddler stupid or something?

965
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,839
Jesus!  look at you both

966
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,519
The greatest detectives in the world!

967
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,199
Am I the only one who knows the
difference between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"</i>?

968
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:36,999
Jesus!

969
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,879
<i>No habla espanol</i> guys?

970
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,039
Do me a favor, motherfucker, shut up!

971
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,599
Do you think he made a mistake?

972
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:44,759
He doesn't make mistakes.

973
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,039
A rat with wings?

974
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,599
Do you know how that sounds to me?

975
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,799
A damn bat!
have you ever thought about it

976
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,959
"You are <i>El Rata.</i>"

977
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,118
"She"...

978
01:28:00,329 --> 01:28:01,300
"are"...

979
01:28:01,506 --> 01:28:02,475
"El."

980
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,599
Maybe it was a mistake.

981
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,759
-Maybe he's not as smart as...
-Wait.

982
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,599
Is that him?

983
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:21,999
Holy shit.

984
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,719
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

985
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,279
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed...

986
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,599
"But in a villa, in a slum...

987
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,639
"I'll never know where I'm from.

988
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,759
"Do you know what I am?"

989
01:29:23,995 --> 01:29:24,924
Any idea?

990
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,199
Yes.

991
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,159
It's an orphan.

992
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,799
A villa in a slum.

993
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,919
-He's talking about the old orphanage.
-The one that burned down?

994
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,519
It was part of the Wayne estate.

995
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,479
They donated it after building the tower.

996
01:29:48,785 --> 01:29:49,725
Let's go.

997
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,519
You can tell I'm still here, right?

998
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,839
will you untie me

999
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,519
How the hell am I
supposed to get out of here?

1000
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,399
Hey!

1001
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,439
You damn son of a bitch!

1002
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,559
No weapons.

1003
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,039
Yes man.  this is your thing

1004
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:56,409
drop heads.

1005
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,071
What the hell is that?

1006
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,319
<i>Thanks.  Thank you very much.</i>

1007
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,639
<i>Wasn't that nice?</i>

1008
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,479
<i>Thank you all.  Thanks.</i>

1009
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,439
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1010
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,719
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1011
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,839
<i>I believe in his promise.</i>

1012
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,559
<i>But too many have
stayed behind too long...</i>

1013
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,799
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1014
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,719
<i>Announcing not just my
candidacy for mayor...</i>

1015
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,159
<i>but also the creation of
the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1016
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,559
<i>Win or lose...</i>

1017
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,436
<i>The Wayne Foundation
pledges a $1 billion donation...</i>

1018
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,759
<i>establish a charitable
foundation for public works.</i>

1019
01:31:55,998 --> 01:32:00,120
<i>I would like to avoid the political standstill
and get money for people and projects...</i>

1020
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,359
<i>who needs that now...</i>

1021
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,959
<i>like these kids behind me.</i>

1022
01:32:04,197 --> 01:32:05,439
"Sins of the Father."

1023
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,279
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It's about planting seeds...</i>

1024
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,479
<i>...and renew Gotham's promise.</i>

1025
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,479
Should be visited on the son.

1026
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:23,672
Jesus.  His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1027
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,759
Hey!

1028
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,919
-Hello?
-Dory!  I need to speak to Alfred!

1029
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,879
<i>-Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
-Listen to me!

1030
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,519
Something terrible is about to happen!

1031
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,239
I'm afraid that's it, sir.

1032
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,799
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1033
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,639
I am so sorry.

1034
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,879
I tried to contact you.

1035
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,279
<i>The package was meant for you.</i>

1036
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,519
It was a C-4 explosive that was
sent in the mail.  We found that too.

1037
01:34:29,318 --> 01:34:30,799
We sedated him.

1038
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,599
We just have to hope it stabilizes.

1039
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,159
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1040
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,479
Is there anyone else to notify?

1041
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,119
next of kin?

1042
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,399
No.

1043
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,159
it's just me

1044
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,399
Selina?

1045
01:36:41,078 --> 01:36:41,924
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1046
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,559
- Yes I can see you.
-<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1047
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,559
<i>where can we go</i>

1048
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,119
Cat burglar pulling another notch?

1049
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,559
-What?
- Wasn't sure if I'd see you again.

1050
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,199
Yeah, well, things were
getting a little hot for me, so...

1051
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,519
How could they do this to her?

1052
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,559
That piece of bullshit, Kenzie.

1053
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,559
Her body was in his car.

1054
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,719
I'll find him and make him
pay for it.  Will you help me?

1055
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,559
Help you?

1056
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,639
Yes.  I thought you were "revenge".

1057
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,519
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1058
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,399
She didn't know any better.  Maybe
you should have explained it to her.

1059
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,159
What the hell does that mean?

1060
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,599
It means your decisions have consequences.

1061
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,039
Jesus Christ.  "Selection"?

1062
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,919
You know, whoever the hell you
are, you obviously grew up rich.

1063
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,839
-Was it worth it?
-What?

1064
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,319
Compromise yourself for money?

1065
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,919
What did you have to do to create this score?

1066
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,159
How close did you have to get to Penguin?
After Falcone?

1067
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,999
You don't know what the hell you're
talking about.  Falcone owes me the money.

1068
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,839
-He owes you?
-Yes, and much more.

1069
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,759
-For real?  Why is this?
-You know what?  I can't even talk to you.

1070
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,560
No!  I want to know why a
guy like Falcone owes you.

1071
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,239
Because he is my father!

1072
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,039
My mother worked at 44 Below.

1073
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,879
Just like Annie.

1074
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,599
When I was a little girl,
she used to take me there.

1075
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,999
To the club?

1076
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,119
Yes.

1077
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,519
I hid in the dressing
room while she worked.

1078
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,759
Saw him there once.

1079
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,479
He scared me to death.

1080
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,879
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1081
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:52,159
Then one night my mother told me who he was.

1082
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,959
When I was seven my mother was murdered.

1083
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,119
strangled.

1084
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:04,039
Never found out who.
Probably a creep from the club.

1085
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:10,199
Anyway, social services came to
pick me up and they didn't say anything.

1086
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,839
couldn't even look at me

1087
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:19,359
He owes me the money.

1088
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,519
I'm sorry.

1089
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,879
For what I said

1090
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,639
It's all right.

1091
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,279
They assume the worst in people.

1092
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,559
What, well...

1093
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,759
maybe we're not that different.

1094
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,999
Who are you under there?

1095
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,959
what are you hiding

1096
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,119
Are you right now...

1097
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,479
terribly scarred?

1098
01:40:04,637 --> 01:40:05,599
Yes.

1099
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,239
Listen to me.

1100
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,599
If we don't stand up for Annika, nobody will.

1101
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:24,423
All that cares about this place
are these privileged white assholes.

1102
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,079
The mayor, the commissioner, the prosecutor.

1103
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,519
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1104
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,879
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, this psycho
has every right to take care of these creeps.

1105
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,279
I think you would be on his side.

1106
01:40:34,557 --> 01:40:35,829
What do you mean by
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1107
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,959
What, do you live in a cave?

1108
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,199
The latest from The Riddler.
It's all about the Waynes.

1109
01:40:41,337 --> 01:40:45,239
Listen, if I can find that asshole Kenzie...

1110
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,519
Will you help me?

1111
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,999
Please.

1112
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,719
come on revenge

1113
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,479
Just don't do moves
without me, got it?

1114
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:00,119
It's a little more dangerous than you think...

1115
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,199
I told you baby

1116
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,719
I can look after myself.

1117
01:41:26,526 --> 01:41:29,754
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne and I agree with this message.</i>

1118
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,159
<i>From a young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1119
01:41:41,377 --> 01:41:45,766
<i>...instilled in both of us that
giving back isn't just a duty...</i>

1120
01:41:46,002 --> 01:41:47,361
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1121
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,489
<i>This is our family's legacy.</i>

1122
01:41:51,766 --> 01:41:53,867
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1123
01:41:54,139 --> 01:41:56,349
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1124
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:59,775
<i>But what is her real legacy?</i>

1125
01:42:01,152 --> 01:42:05,621
<i>Twenty years ago, a reporter
set out to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1126
01:42:06,047 --> 01:42:09,576
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1127
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:14,234
<i>How, when Martha was a child, her
mother brutally murdered her father...</i>

1128
01:42:14,619 --> 01:42:15,964
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1129
01:42:16,225 --> 01:42:21,611
<i>and how the Arkhams used their
power and money to cover it up.</i>

1130
01:42:21,912 --> 01:42:26,391
<i>As Martha herself has been in
and out of institutions for years...</i>

1131
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,959
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1132
01:42:29,809 --> 01:42:32,180
<i>Thomas Wayne tried to
coerce that Crusade reporter...</i>

1133
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:36,330
<i>into a hush-money deal to
save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1134
01:42:36,961 --> 01:42:38,916
<i>But when the reporter refused</i>

1135
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:43,254
<i>... Wayne reached out to longtime
secret collaborator Carmaine Falcone...</i>

1136
01:42:43,465 --> 01:42:45,920
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1137
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,079
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams...</i>

1138
01:42:49,799 --> 01:42:54,724
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1139
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:57,719
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1140
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,199
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1141
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,759
<i>And Gotham needs your answer...</i>

1142
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,719
<i>for your father's sins.</i>

1143
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,999
<i>Good bye.</i>

1144
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,879
Do you know who I am?

1145
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,519
You are Bruce Wayne.

1146
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,599
I want to see Carmine Falcone.

1147
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:33,039
See?

1148
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,279
Who is this guy who invented the ball, right?

1149
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,199
Must have made a fortune.

1150
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,359
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1151
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,199
Briscoe, do you know how
much that sweater cost?

1152
01:43:56,468 --> 01:43:57,427
no, boss

1153
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,879
$1,183.

1154
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,279
You know why communism failed, right?

1155
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,439
no, boss

1156
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,639
austerity.

1157
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,519
Understood.  Understood.

1158
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,039
Look at this.  Perfect.

1159
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,999
It will never be this good again.

1160
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,559
Hello Johnny Slick.

1161
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,759
What are you doing here?

1162
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,639
Give us a moment here guys.

1163
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,679
Come on.

1164
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:29,759
See you champion.

1165
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:31,999
come on honey

1166
01:44:34,036 --> 01:44:34,951
Have a seat.

1167
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,799
I thought I might hear from you.

1168
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:43,079
This Riddler, this son
of a bitch, is really...

1169
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,319
stirs things up, doesn't it?

1170
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,159
-Is it true?
-What?

1171
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,119
The reporter business?

1172
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,679
What do you want to know here, little one?

1173
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,559
did you kill him  For my father?

1174
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,399
Look, your father was in trouble.

1175
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,999
This reporter had some dirt.

1176
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,799
Some very...

1177
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,439
Personal things about your mother...

1178
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,719
her family history.

1179
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,719
Everyone has their dirty
laundry, that's the way it is.

1180
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,999
But he didn't want none of that to
come out, not just before the election.

1181
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:19,399
And your father tried to pay
the guy off, but he didn't want to.

1182
01:45:19,565 --> 01:45:21,173
In order to...

1183
01:45:21,379 --> 01:45:22,639
He came to me.

1184
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,159
Well, I've never seen him like this before.

1185
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,479
He said, "Carmine...

1186
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:33,319
"I want you to put the
fear of God into this guy."

1187
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,679
And if fear isn't enough...

1188
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,839
Your father wanted me to take care of it, so I did.

1189
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,679
I handled it.

1190
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,679
I know.

1191
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,119
You thought your father was a boy scout.

1192
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,116
But you will be surprised...

1193
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,599
what even a good man like him...

1194
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,279
able in the right situation.

1195
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,999
Do me a favour.

1196
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,439
Don't lose sleep over it.

1197
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,759
This reporter...

1198
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:13,039
was a low life.

1199
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,719
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1200
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,799
- chestnuts?
-Oh yeah.

1201
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,959
He never liked your
father and I had history.

1202
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:26,759
And after what happened to
that reporter, Maroni was worried...

1203
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,279
that your father would be in my pocket...

1204
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,959
forever.

1205
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,639
He would have done anything...

1206
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,879
so he doesn't become mayor.

1207
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,399
You understand?

1208
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,039
Are you saying that Salvatore
Maroni killed my father?

1209
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,279
Do I know for sure?

1210
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,759
I'm just saying, it certainly
looked that way to me.

1211
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,359
That's what you wanted, huh?

1212
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,839
This little conversation here?

1213
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,479
It took a long time.

1214
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,279
I mean you're not a kid anymore.

1215
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:15,839
You lied to me...

1216
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,359
My whole life.

1217
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,599
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1218
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:33,959
He told me what he did for my father.

1219
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,439
About Salvatore Maroni.

1220
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,119
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1221
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,959
Killed my father.

1222
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,639
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1223
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,959
I spent all those
years fighting for him...

1224
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,239
to believe that he was a good man.

1225
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,039
He was a good man.

1226
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,799
you listen to me

1227
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,359
Your father was a good man.

1228
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,799
-He made a mistake.
-A mistake."

1229
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,839
He had a man killed.

1230
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,079
Why?

1231
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,519
To protect his family image?

1232
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,679
His political ambitions?

1233
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,479
It wasn't to protect the family image
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1234
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,599
He protected your mother.

1235
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,039
He didn't care about his
image or the campaign.

1236
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,199
He took care of her...

1237
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,359
And you...

1238
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,599
and in a moment of
weakness he turned to Falcone.

1239
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,399
But he never thought
Falcone would kill that man.

1240
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,439
Your father should have known
Falcone would do anything...

1241
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,559
finally having something
with him that he can use.

1242
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,439
This is Falcone.

1243
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,079
And that was your father's fault.

1244
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:05,039
But when Falcone told him what he
had done, your father was in despair.

1245
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,999
He told Falcone he was going to the police...

1246
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,319
that he would confess anything.

1247
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,719
And that night...

1248
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,519
your father and mother...

1249
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,759
were killed.

1250
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,039
Was it Falcone?

1251
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,199
I wish I knew for sure.

1252
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,399
Or maybe it was a
random thug on the street...

1253
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,319
who needed money, got scared
and pulled the trigger too quickly.

1254
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,559
If you don't believe that I spent
every day looking for this answer...

1255
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:56,239
It was my job to protect her.
Do you understand?

1256
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,759
I know you always blamed yourself.

1257
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,279
You were just a boy Bruce.

1258
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,719
I could see the fear in your eyes...

1259
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,559
but I didn't know how to help.

1260
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,359
I could teach you how to fight...

1261
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,119
but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.

1262
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,079
you needed a father

1263
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,519
And all you had was me.

1264
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,039
I'm sorry.

1265
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,719
Don't apologize Alfred.

1266
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,599
God.

1267
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:44,999
I never thought I would
ever feel this fear again.

1268
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,879
I thought I had mastered it all.

1269
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,519
I mean...

1270
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,879
I'm not afraid to die.

1271
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,999
I realize now there is something...

1272
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,999
I didn't come by.

1273
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,639
This fear...

1274
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:16,119
ever having to go through something like this again.

1275
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:22,479
Losing someone I care about.

1276
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,159
hey

1277
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,959
I saw the signal.  That is not you?

1278
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,879
I thought that was you

1279
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,319
-I found him!
-I see that.

1280
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:34,959
He had my shit and my phone.

1281
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,119
She left a message the night they
kidnapped her.  She called me...

1282
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,959
Gordon!  help me man

1283
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,399
She has my gun!

1284
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,439
-Keep your mouth shut!
-Put down the gun.

1285
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,519
I'm telling you, damn it!  She called me!

1286
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,239
Here.  Listen.

1287
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,879
<i>Hey!  Come back here!</i>

1288
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,999
<i>Where are you going?  Come back!</i>

1289
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,199
<i>Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1290
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,679
<i>you scare her</i>

1291
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,399
<i>I'm sorry Mr Falcone.</i>

1292
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,879
<i>Please, please, please.
Please don't hurt me, please.</i>

1293
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:10,759
<i>Hey, don't worry.  Come here.</i>

1294
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,599
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1295
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,799
<i>-What did Mitchell tell you?
-No nothing.  He...</i>

1296
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,759
<i>Don liked to talk.  I know that.</i>

1297
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,679
<i>Especially for pretty girls like you.</i>

1298
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,199
<i>That's why I made him take your passport...</i>

1299
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,759
<i>until we could have this little conversation.</i>

1300
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,519
<i>I just want out of here, okay?</i>

1301
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,719
<i>You'll never hear from me
again, no one will.  Please please...</i>

1302
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,999
<i>We'll get you out of here, I promise.</i>

1303
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:41,399
<i>But first I need to know...</i>

1304
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,839
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1305
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:48,159
<i>He just said they all made a deal with you.</i>

1306
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,799
<i>He told you about it, huh?</i>

1307
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,159
<i>The deal.</i>

1308
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:58,159
<i>He said you gave some
information about a drip thing...</i>

1309
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,999
<i>and so he became mayor.</i>

1310
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,439
<i>He said you are a very important man.</i>

1311
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:04,719
<i>To the right.</i>

1312
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:09,959
<i>In order.</i>

1313
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,879
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1314
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,479
<i>Jesus, he strangles her.</i>

1315
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,759
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1316
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,223
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1317
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,799
Even a hawk has wings.

1318
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,919
Falcone is the rat?

1319
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,039
Falcone works for you?

1320
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,279
The mayor?  That one?

1321
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,359
No.

1322
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,719
We work for him.

1323
01:56:09,806 --> 01:56:10,896
everyone does.

1324
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:12,079
How?

1325
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,719
Through renewal.

1326
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:15,599
Renewal is everything.

1327
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,319
-The renewal fund?
-Yes.

1328
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:21,599
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all followed him like vultures.

1329
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:25,279
The Mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone agreed.

1330
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,639
It was perfect for taking
bribes and laundering money.

1331
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:32,556
A huge charitable fund with no
oversight.  Everyone got a piece.

1332
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,639
But Falcone wanted more.

1333
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,599
So he orchestrated a play to
bring Maroni down in a big way.

1334
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,319
He would betray his Drops operation...

1335
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,359
Make the careers of
all who came after him...

1336
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,879
then install them all as his puppets.

1337
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,679
Do you think this goddamn election matters?

1338
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:55,159
Falcone is the mayor.

1339
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,519
He has been mayor for 20 years.

1340
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:00,079
come on revenge

1341
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,599
Let's kill this son of a bitch.

1342
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,879
-This creep too.  let's end this
-Oh God!

1343
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:05,759
No!

1344
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,519
We get him.

1345
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,079
-But not like this.
-There is no other way!

1346
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,199
He owns the city!

1347
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:13,639
Cross that line...

1348
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,719
you will become just like him.

1349
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,879
Listen to me.

1350
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,879
Don't throw your life away.

1351
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:27,839
don't worry honey

1352
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,359
I have nine of these.

1353
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,439
No, not!  Hello Hello!

1354
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,039
Oh God!

1355
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,479
She won't get out of there alive.

1356
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:50,079
And if she kills Falcone, we
may never find the Riddler.

1357
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,199
I have to stop her.

1358
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,439
Don't you mean "we"?

1359
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,239
I have to do this my way.

1360
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,559
And then what?

1361
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:58,839
We're doing what Riddler said.

1362
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,319
Bring the rat to light.

1363
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,199
Can you tell Mr. Falcone I want to come upstairs?

1364
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,879
He doesn't see anyone tonight.

1365
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,799
Tell him it's about Annika.

1366
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:47,399
Hey!

1367
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,519
Look who it is, huh?

1368
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,079
-Sorry to bother you.
-Nope.  It's beautiful, beautiful.

1369
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,141
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1370
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,799
Absolutely.

1371
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:58,359
Alone?

1372
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,199
Hey!

1373
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:27,879
I'm just so worried.

1374
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,639
I do not know where she is.

1375
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:34,839
And I know that you are a very important man.

1376
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,239
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1377
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:42,479
because she's been gone
for so long, I'm starting to...

1378
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:44,559
I'm sorry.

1379
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,039
It's OK.

1380
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,239
-I am so sorry.
-I understand.  Here.

1381
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,279
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1382
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,399
Mister Falcone?

1383
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:57,919
Vinni!  Didn't I tell you?

1384
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,999
I'm sorry Mr Falcone.  I really
think you will want to see this.

1385
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:04,879
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1386
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,279
I'll be right back.

1387
02:00:21,697 --> 02:00:22,759
Holy shit.

02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,119
Yes.

1407

1409
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,039
I see him!

1410
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,879
Don't you think this hurts me?

1411
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,719
My own flesh and blood.

1412
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,919
You made me.

1413
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:39,079
Just like your mother.

1414
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:46,399
He has to pay!

1415
02:03:50,436 --> 02:03:51,434
You don't have to pay him.

1416
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:56,630
you paid enough

1417
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,199
Jesus.

1418
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:35,039
look at you man  What
do you think this is?

1419
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:38,199
Do you think you scare me
with that mask and cloak?

1420
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,079
I start to cry and suddenly
a big secret comes out?

1421
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,719
let me tell you something

1422
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,559
What I know...

1423
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,559
whatever i did...

1424
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,119
everything works for me...

1425
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,999
to my grave

1426
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,519
What, are you over here with Zoro?

1427
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:08,399
Don't you know you guys in blue work for me?

1428
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,719
I guess we don't all work for you.

1429
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,199
You have the right to remain silent.

1430
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:33,559
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in court.

1431
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:34,959
You have the right to an attorney.

1432
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,039
If you can't afford one, the city of
Gotham will provide one for you.

1433
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,959
Do you understand these rights?

1434
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,959
Do you understand?

1435
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:45,959
Yes.

1436
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,119
I'll see you when I go out.

1437
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,559
With these rights in mind, is there
anything else you would like to say...

1438
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,999
Damn rat.

1439
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:55,199
What would you say?

1440
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:57,079
Enjoy your night out in Blackgate, Carmine.

1441
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,479
Probably your last.

1442
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,719
So you're a big man now, Oz?

1443
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:03,879
Maybe I am

1444
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,199
Really Oz?

1445
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:10,079
Because to me you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1446
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,112
I will spray your ass!

1447
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,359
What are you doing right now?  It was not me!

1448
02:06:16,802 --> 02:06:18,839
I didn't shoot!  I didn't shoot!

1449
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,599
hands off me

1450
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,199
"Bring him to light.

1451
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,599
"And you will find out where I am."

1452
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,759
There!

1453
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:51,759
The shots came from up there!

1454
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,399
It's Riddler.

1455
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,519
Gage, on me.

1456
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:00,439
Martinez, around the back.
Nobody comes in, nobody gets out!

1457
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:15,719
He is gone.

1458
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,439
He was here all the time.

1459
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,879
-Lieutenant.  Martinez.
-Yes?

1460
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,999
<i>Lieutenant, we have a witness here...</i>

1461
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,759
<i>says she saw someone coming
down the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1462
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,319
<i>She said he went to the corner restaurant.</i>

1463
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,399
<i>The guy is sitting alone
at the counter right now.</i>

1464
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,959
Police!  Hands up!

1465
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:03,519
He said put your goddamn
hands up you son of a bitch.

1466
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,559
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1467
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,719
Stay quiet!

1468
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:29,879
Now!

1469
02:09:58,648 --> 02:10:00,321
Which one are you?

1470
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,959
You tell me.

1471
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:04,199
Let's go, pencilneck.

1472
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,039
Get this out!

1473
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:26,359
<i>...where even the wife and son of
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. were murdered...</i>

1474
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:29,159
<i>have gathered for an emotional
show of unity in the city.</i>

1475
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:31,679
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live at
Real's headquarters right now...</i>

1476
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,799
hey

1477
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:58,999
What are all these diaries?

1478
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:01,479
They are ledgers.  He has thousands.

1479
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:05,119
He scribbled all over her.
Ramblings, ciphers, codes.

1480
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:06,679
I got something back on one of the ID cards.

1481
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:09,119
Edward Nashton.  Works at KTMJ.

1482
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,999
-He's a forensic accountant.
-Accountant?

1483
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,479
Hey Lieutenant!  Do you agree?

1484
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,399
What about the chain of evidence?

1485
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,519
You should see that.

1486
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,919
He wears gloves.

1487
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:28,599
"Friday, July 16th.

1488
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,359
"My life was a cruel mystery
that I could not solve...

1489
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:35,719
"Suffocating my mind, no escape.

1490
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,279
"But today I saw it.

1491
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:41,519
“A single word on that ledger
that sits on the desk next to me.

1492
02:11:42,909 --> 02:11:44,506
"'Renovation.'

1493
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,119
"The empty promise they sold me
in that orphanage when I was a kid.

1494
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,439
One look inside and I finally understood.

1495
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,199
“One look inside and I finally understood.

1496
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:55,679
"My whole life has
prepared me for this.

1497
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,159
"The moment I would learn the truth.

1498
02:11:58,425 --> 02:12:02,438
“When I was finally able to
fight back and expose their lies.

1499
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:06,159
"If you want people to
understand, really understand...

1500
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,513
"You can't just give them the answers.

1501
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:12,599
"You have to confront them, torment
them with the terrible questions...

1502
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,959
"The way they tortured me.

1503
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:17,759
"I now know what I have to become."

1504
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,079
Jesus.

1505
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:30,159
I don't think the rat likes you, man.

1506
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,159
This isn't a rat.

1507
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:49,999
What is it?

1508
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,759
Some kind of leverage tool?

1509
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,119
is it a chisel

1510
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,679
It's a murder weapon.

1511
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:27,199
He killed Mitchell with it.

1512
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,599
The edge corresponds to the
floorboard look in the mayor's office.

1513
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,199
"My denomination"?

1514
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:44,279
what does he confess  He
already told us he killed Mitchell.

1515
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:45,679
This isn't over yet.

1516
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:48,239
Oh man.
He posts all sorts of shit online.

1517
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:50,879
He has about 500 followers.
Real border types.

1518
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:01,039
His last post was last night.

1519
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:04,399
any video.  Has many views
but it is password protected.

1520
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:07,199
-Can you come in?
-Copy his drive now.

1521
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:11,039
Take your time, but we're getting in.

1522
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:24,839
-Show me the post.
-It's right here.

1523
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,239
"The Exposed Truth."

1524
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:30,679
I think I'm his final target.

1525
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,359
You?

1526
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:36,799
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1527
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:38,719
What is?

1528
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,639
The Batman.

1529
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,159
Yes?

1530
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,639
To the right.

1531
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:06,479
Riddler is asking for you.  At Arkham.

1532
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,359
You are a good cop.

1533
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:42,399
<i>I told you I would see you in hell.</i>

1534
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,959
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1535
02:15:45,172 --> 02:15:46,737
"Want"?

1536
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:50,759
<i>If you only knew how
long I've waited for this day.</i>

1537
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:53,359
<i>For this moment.</i>

1538
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:57,359
<i>I've been invisible all my life.</i>

1539
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:01,079
<i>I think I'll be no more, right?</i>

1540
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:04,959
<i>You will remember me now.</i>

1541
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:06,919
<i>You will remember us both.</i>

1542
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,279
<i>Bruce...</i>

1543
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:23,959
<i>Wayne.<i>

1544
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,199
<i>Bruce...</i>

1545
02:16:31,661 --> 02:16:34,399
<i>wayne</i>

1546
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:48,119
<i>You know I was there that day.</i>

1547
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:53,959
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor...</i>

1548
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,479
<i>made all those promises</i>

1549
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,199
<i>Well, a week later he was dead
and everyone just forgot about us.</i>

1550
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:07,199
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1551
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,079
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1552
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,084
<i>Orphaned.</i>

1553
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:23,919
<i>Living in a tower over
the park is not an orphan.</i>

1554
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,879
<i>Looking down on
everyone with all that money.</i>

1555
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:32,039
<i>Do not tell me.</i>

1556
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:37,359
Do you know what it means to be an orphan?

1557
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:40,279
<i>There are 30 children in one room.</i>

1558
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:45,639
<i>Twelve years old and already
a sucker who numbs the pain.</i>

1559
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:51,999
<i>You wake up screaming
while rats chew on your fingers.</i>

1560
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:56,239
<i>And every winter one of the babies dies...</i>

1561
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,719
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1562
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:02,599
<i>But oh no.</i>

1563
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:08,559
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying dead daddy...</i>

1564
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:11,599
<i>because at least the
money goes down easily.</i>

1565
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:12,879
<i>Not true?</i>

1566
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:16,279
<i>Bruce...</i>

1567
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:19,279
<i>wayne</i>

1568
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,999
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1569
02:18:29,520 --> 02:18:32,559
<i>But we have the rest of them, right?</i>

1570
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:37,879
<i>All those slick, messy, fake stitches.</i>

1571
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,279
<i>God.</i>

1572
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,479
<i>Look at you.</i>

1573
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:48,599
<i>Your mask is great.</i>

1574
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:51,559
<i>I wish you could have seen me in mine.</i>

1575
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:52,799
<i>Is not It Funny?</i>

1576
02:18:53,111 --> 02:18:57,233
<i>All everyone wants to do is expose
you, but they're missing the point.</i>

1577
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:00,799
<i>You and I both know...</i>

1578
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:01,799
<i></i>

1579
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:04,199
<i>I'm looking at the real you right now.</i>

1580
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,439
<i>My mask allowed me to be myself...</i>

1581
02:19:06,647 --> 02:19:07,844
<i>Completely.</i>

1582
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:09,559
<i>no shame...</i>

1583
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,519
<i>no limits.</i>

1584
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:13,239
<i>why did you text me</i>

1585
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,159
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1586
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:16,799
<i>All those cards.</i>

1587
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,759
<i>I told you...</i>

1588
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,719
<i>we did this together
You are part of it.</i>

1589
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:23,079
<i>- We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1590
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,767
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1591
02:19:24,867 --> 02:19:26,768
<i>I asked you to bring
it to light and you did.</i>

1592
02:19:27,153 --> 02:19:27,993
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1593
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:29,119
<i>We are not a team.</i>

1594
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:31,519
<i>I could never have gotten him out of there.</i>

1595
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:34,039
<i>I am not physical.  My strength is up here.</i>

1596
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:37,359
<i>I mean I had all the parts.
I had the answers.</i>

1597
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:39,039
But I didn't know how to get her to listen.

1598
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:40,399
you gave me that

1599
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:41,679
<i>I didn't give you anything</i>

1600
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:44,199
You showed me what's possible.

1601
02:19:44,423 --> 02:19:49,119
<i>You showed me that all it takes is
fear and a little bit of targeted violence.</i>

1602
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,919
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1603
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:52,479
<i>You've gone insane</i>

1604
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:54,559
<i>What?</i>

1605
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,879
<i>It's all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1606
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,279
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1607
02:19:58,504 --> 02:19:59,870
Do you think you will be remembered?

1608
02:20:00,079 --> 02:20:01,675
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath...</i>

1609
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,839
- ask for attention.
-<i>No.</i>

1610
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,639
<i>-You will die alone in Arkham.</i>
-No.

1611
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:06,719
<i>No no!</i>

1612
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:07,839
<i>A nobody!</i>

1613
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:11,439
<i>No!</i>

1614
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:18,559
<i>It shouldn't work like that!</i>

1615
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,839
<i>I had everything planned!</i>

1616
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:28,839
<i>We would be safe here.</i>

1617
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:32,399
We could watch the whole thing together.

1618
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,599
<i>See something?</i>

1619
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,479
<i>All!</i>

1620
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,479
<i>It was all there.</i>

1621
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:49,959
<i>You mean you haven't figured it out?</i>

1622
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:58,079
<i>Oh, you really aren't as
smart as I thought you were.</i>

1623
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:02,239
<i>I think I gave you too much credit.</i>

1624
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,959

1625
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:09,559

-I really do not know it.

To the right.  Hey listen!  Calm!

1704
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:21,239

and get the mayor-elect out of here right now.

1705

-Where is she?
-I can take you there.

-I thought this was a last-choice haven.

<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1754
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,159
<i>I made an impact here...</i>

1755
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:23,159
<i>but not the ones I intended.</i>

1756
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,559
<i>Revenge won't change the past...</i>

1757
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:32,279
<i>mine or someone else's.</i>

1758
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:36,759
<i>I need to become more</i>

1759
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:41,479
<i>people need hope.</i>

1760
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,879
<i>Knowing that someone is there for her.</i>

1761
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:50,319
<i>The city is angry.</i>

1762
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:52,639
<i>scarred...</i>

1763
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:54,799
<i>like me.</i>

1764
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,999
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1765
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:03,039
<i>Even after the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1766
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,439
<i>But if we survive them...</i>

1767
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,839
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1768
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:13,639
<i>You can give us the power...</i>

1769
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:16,079
<i>endure...</i>

1770
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,639
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1771
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:24,559
<i>We live.  As you can see...</i>

1772
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:27,479
<i>the masked vigilante at
Gotham Square Garden...</i>

1773
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:30,839
<i>help save the lives
of hundreds of victims.</i>

1774
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:33,959
<i>And now, with first responders
desperate to help the injured...</i>

1775
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:36,519
<i>A mysterious masked man appears...</i>

1776
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:38,919
<i>heroically pulling the victims
straight through the skylight...</i>

1777
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:41,559
Isn't that just awful?

1778
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:44,799
Him...

1779
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:47,839
is it raining like that on your parade?

1780
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:55,559
What do you say?

1781
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:58,839
"One day you'll be up there...

1782
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:02,079
"the next...

1783
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:05,359
"You are a clown."

1784
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:08,861
Fountain...

1785
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,479
Let me tell you,
there are worse things.

1786
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:18,479
hey hey hey  Do not be sad.

1787
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,599
you did so well

1788
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:27,119
And you know...

1789
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:31,999
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1790
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:43,439
Who are you?

1791
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:46,359
Well that's the question...

1792
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,759
Is not it?

1793
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:54,079
puzzle me that...

1794
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:59,199
"The less you have of it...

1795
02:42:59,480 --> 02:43:03,239
"the more you are worth."

1796
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,439
A friend.

1797
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:37,599
You leave.

1798
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,639
Jesus.

1799
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,893
Don't you ever just say hello?

1800
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,479
where will you go

1801
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,319
I do not know.  Backland.

1802
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:55,479
Bludhaven maybe.

1803
02:43:56,478 --> 02:43:57,265
Why?

1804
02:43:58,640 --> 02:43:59,759
you ask me to stay

1805
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,639
You know this place will never change.

1806
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:11,719
With Carmine gone, things
will only get worse for you.

1807
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:13,519
There will be a power takeover.

1808
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:16,479
It's going to be bloody.

1809
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:18,239
I know.

1810
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:20,999
But the city can change.

1811
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:22,239
It will not.

1812
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:24,399
I have to try

1813
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,279
It will kill you eventually.
You know that.

1814
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:29,639
Listen.

1815
02:44:32,140 --> 02:44:33,257
why don't you come with me

1816
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:35,719
Get into trouble.

1817
02:44:36,551 --> 02:44:40,039
Knock off some CEO hedge
fund dudes.  It will be fun.

1818
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:42,159
The bat and the cat.

1819
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:45,479
It has a beautiful ring.

1820
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:00,199
Who am I kidding?

1821
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:03,799
You are already taken.

1822
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,039
you should go

1823
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:26,439
Selina...

1824
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:32,199
Take care of yourself.
